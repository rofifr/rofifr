Hi, I'm Rofi Fathurrohman, I'm an IT student who doesn't have an IT soul and I'm forced to explore this IT world, because I'm a student who originally majored in the wrong field. Initially I had an interest in the field of graphic design, and in the end after I studied at the IT campus, I began to think ðŸ¤” what if my interest in graphic design was combined with the IT world? hmm... good idea. As a beginner in the IT field, I want to continue learning to achieve this so that hopefully I can combine graphic design and web developer. follow me on instagram instagram.com/rofifr.abi/.

Skills: REACT / JS / HTML / CSS / FLUTTER / TAILWINDCSS
